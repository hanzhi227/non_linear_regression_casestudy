Things to look into: 
    -comparing models 
    -graphing to find the best hyperparameters ... which hyperparameters? 
    -find the best model on the hold out data GOAL 
    -cross validation
    -gradient boosted regressor vs randomforests 
        - how is error reduced as the gradient boosted regressor progresses 
    -grid search to find hyperparameters
